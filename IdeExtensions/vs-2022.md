* Bundled template - no need to manually install the template from a zip
* The template has more features than the normal template, including GitHub actions for build verification
  and faster releases
* Dependency Management - Auto-detects your HK installation and installed mods; Manage Mod Dependencies 
  context action allows you to pick mods and add them to your workflow build in a single step
